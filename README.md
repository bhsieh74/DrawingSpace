Drawing on the Web Final Project
As a kid, space always fascinated me. No one knows what else is out there or even how vast space actually is. It is a complete enigma for even our top NASA scientists. As a result, I want to build on this and represent space through code and show the sheer scale and mystery that space holds. My navigation page will be a simple homepage with links to the other three drawings. It will have a dark, space-themed background. My first drawing will use THREE.js and have a space cubemap. With this drawing, I am going to add the planets in our solar system and attempt to scale them to size. By including Earth in this drawing, visitors will see how small Earth is. My second drawing will be a simple webpage that utilizes animations and transitions to have various images/gifs (rockets, asteroids, comets, etc) scroll across the screen. My third drawing will be a carousel of space-themed things, such as black holes, stars, and galaxies with buttons to be able to speed up, slow down, pause, and play. It will use JavaScript with event listeners to be able to change the carouselâ€™s properties. After leaving the site, visitors will leave wondering what else exists in this endless space.
